- What does this do?

https://github.com/heliohackweek/polar_coronal_holes/blob/master/data_preparation/steps_data_preparation.ipynb
- This looks like the best starting code to work with, although there are known issues with data prep.

https://github.com/heliohackweek/polar_coronal_holes/blob/master/data_preparation/kconvol.pro
- This program will smooth an array, including the edges, using IDL's SMOOTH or CONVOL functions, by surrounding the array with duplicates of itself and then convolving the larger array.

This seems to be the code Ben used at the HackWeek with some sample data that was not exactly ready for use (known issues).
